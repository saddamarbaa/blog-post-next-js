I have been using JavaScript since the beginning of my coding career! I used it to build simple websites and I used it to build large scale applications! Now I use it to teach others, as well as create large applications. The possibilities of this language are endless, and the use cases keep increasing every single day!

For example, you should understand code like this:

```js
const basics = 'Okay, that should not be too difficult actually';

function printBasics() {
  console.log(basics):
}

printBasics();
```
