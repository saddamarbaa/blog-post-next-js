In college, I met a friend at a computer club who was showing a really cool application where you can swipe between different types of clothing! Being very intrigued, I asked my friend if there is any way I can help out and join the team! After some thinking, he told me to finish an assignment, and then they will consider me. Over the weekend, I finished the assignment and was right away told I can join the team, though I would be working for free. That was completely fine for me!
